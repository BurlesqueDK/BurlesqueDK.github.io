        Burlesque is a theatrical art form with roots in the Italian word burla
        (meaning joke or mockery) and the traditions of
        <i>commedia dell'arte</i>. It is notoriously difficult to define, as
        burlesque is incredibly diverse — ranging from classic, glamorous
        striptease to political satire and avant-garde performances.

        Though predominantly performed by women, burlesque also includes
        <i>boylesque</i>, featuring male performers. In Denmark, the audience is
        often primarily female. While burlesque frequently involves removing a
        significant amount of clothing, it is not a requirement. What truly
        defines burlesque is its extravagance—feathers, glitter, rhinestones,
        sequins, and, of course, <i>pasties</i> with tassels, often accompanied
        by impressive <i>tassel-twirling</i>.

        The performances themselves vary widely, from classic burlesque with
        lavish costumes, elegant choreography, and old-Hollywood glamour to
        comedic acts featuring quirky costumes, unexpected twists, and playful
        storytelling.

        At its core, burlesque is about empowerment, self-expression, and the
        right to own one's body and presence. The community is known for its
        inclusivity and celebration of all body types, genders, and identities,
        making it a welcoming and liberating space for performers and audiences
        alike.
